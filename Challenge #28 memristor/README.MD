Learning goals: 
â€¢  Learn how to model and simulate a memristor, either in Python or in SPICE 
 
Tasks: 
1.  Download or write your own memristor model in SPICE or Python. E.g., you can use the Biolek 
model: https://www.radioeng.cz/fulltexts/2009/09_02_210_214.pdf  
2.  Visualize the characteristic pinched hysteresis loop in the I-V curve. 
3.  Document your results.
